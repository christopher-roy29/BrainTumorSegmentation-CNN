# BrainTumorSegmentation-CNN
Implementation of deep CNN model that was trained to segment the tumor on 3D MRI images. The model was inspired from the ResNet architecture and classified each pixel to be in one of the 5 classes- necrosis, edema, enhancing, non-enhancing tumor, normal tissues. The model was trained and evaluated using the BRATS 2013 dataset and obtained the DICE coefficient of 0.92.
